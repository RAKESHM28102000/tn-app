// [3/14, 9:52 AM] Jack: Chengalpattu district came into existence on 29.11.2019, when it was carved out of the erstwhile Kancheepuram district. Chengalpattu district being part of the Kancheepuram district until recently and being in close geographical proximity to the city of Kancheepuram which is a cultural hub for the region, has undergone through almost all the phases of history which Kancheepuram has witnessed. From 600 AD to 900 AD the region was under the Pallava rule. It was during the Pallava reign that the Chengalpattu region attained the maximum height of prosperity and cultural glory. The temple architecture, as illustrated by the rock cut temple of Mamallapuram and other temples belonging to the contemporary period along the east coast, was at its excellence during the Pallava period.
// [3/14, 9:55 AM] Jack: Another important  phase of the history of Chengalpattu district is the one when the region was reigned  by the Vijaynagara Empire from 1336 AD to 1675 AD. The town of Chengalpattu was formerly a capital of the kings of Vijayanagar after they were defeated by the Deccan sultanate in the battle of Talikota in 1565. The fortress at Chengalpattu, built by the Vijayanagara kings in the 16th century was of much strategic importance owing to the swamp surrounding it and the lake situated beside it.  Chengalpattu was taken by the French in 1751 and was retaken in 1752 by the British Governor Robert Clive.
